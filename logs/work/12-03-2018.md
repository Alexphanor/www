Things I made since the last log:

### Vibedrive Application Architecture

Technically, this is from before the last log I wrote but I forgot to mention it last time.
I've been thinking about how all the moving parts of Vibedrive would fit together for a while now
and I feel like I finally have something that makes sense. Made a little diagram and [wrote a few sentences](https://github.com/vibedrive/vibedrive/wiki/Vibedrive-Application-Architecture) about it.

### Arch Linux

I'm trying to build a custom image (ISO) of Arch Linux at work.
It's to install on a digital signage display. I want to boot the machine
into an electron app from a usb key and have the whole thing running in ram.

It's just a side project so I haven't spent that much time on it yet but I
[took some notes](https://github.com/kareniel/notes/blob/master/unix/archlinux.md).

### node-traktor

Started writing [a module](https://github.com/kareniel/node-traktor) yesterday to help with
interfacing with Traktor in a Node.js application. It's still at an early stage but I already started using it inside the Vibedrive desktop app. 

### vibedrive-desktop

Made a major refactor of the folder structure yesterday. Haven't had time to thoroughly test the
app yet (there's probably still a few broken links in there) but that felt really good! I've settled on a way to organize code so that I can be more productive. I put the web and mobile app on hiatus so I can focus on putting this baby out the door. I'm still unsure if I want to open source it. But most parts are gonna end up in small modules on npm anyway so it probably doesn't matter.


### newsletter

I'm about to turn these logs into a weekly digest and send it out as a newsletter. I was getting a little overwhelmed with the Vibedrive newsletter because I don't work enough on it in a week to justify a newsletter yet I do want to send people updates so my thinking is that I should make announcements about Vibedrive in my personal newsletter. I really like [Julia Evans]()' format. 

If I copy from it a bit mine would go:

> Hello! Welcome to Jonathan's blog digest for the week. Here are the blog posts I wrote this week! I'm always interested to hear what you think at @Jonathan_Dupre on Twitter.
